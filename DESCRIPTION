Description: This package makes available public Affect Control Theory dictionaries (semantic 
    differential ratings of thousands of different terms) and equations (coefficients for predicting 
    interactions in the context of Affect Control Theory) collected in many cultures and contexts 
    worldwide between 1977 and present. Spellings and formats of all terms have been standardized across
    data sets to enable comparisons. Gender-averaged values have been calculated for all dictionaries,
    and standard deviations and covariance matrices between affective dimensions have been calculated
    where possible.
